__Class__

    - Tu: 4:30 - 7:00 PM
    - Online: Webex (Link will be shared via Blackboard)

__Instructor__ Murat Guner

Office Hours: [By appointment](https://calendly.com/mguner/10min)

email: mguner@umbc.edu

I check my email daily and generally will respond to questions in the evening hours.

If your question is something about your code or something we covered in class then please don't send me email instead schedule an appointment.

I am available after class for questions and help.  Outside of that timeframe, please schedule an appointment.

__Course Description__

The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to and hands on experience with all phases of the data science process using real data and modern tools. Topics that will be covered include data formats, loading, and cleaning; data storage in relational and non-relational stores; data analysis using supervised and unsupervised learning using Python; data visualization; and scaling up for Big Data.

__Learning Objectives__

Upon completion, students will understand:

•   Classify Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries, strings, and dataframes.

•   Produce scatter plots, histograms, and bar graphs (data visualization).

•   Transform raw data into useful information (data characterization).

•   Identify anomalous data and outliers.

•   Employ common Python modules such as random and pandas.

•   Use common data formats such as CSV, JSON, XML.

__Github Repository__

I will use [this Github Repository](https://github.com/mguner/DATA601_SP21) as our course webpage. You can check this page regulary for the updates and important information related to the course.


Please make sure you check [UMBC Data Science - Setup](https://github.com/UMBC-Data-Science/Welcome) and come prepared before the first lecture.

__Textbook__

• "Data Wrangling with Python: Tips and Tools to Make Your Life Easier", first edition by Jacqueline Kazil and Katharine Jarmul. O'Reilly Media (Primary)

• ["Python Data Science Handbook"](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas. O'Reilly Media

• "Think Like a Data Scientist: Tackle the data science process step-by-step" by Brian Godsey. Manning Publications (Optional)

__Course Format and Assignments__

Students will complete assigned homework, readings, quizzes. This course incorporates a variety of hands-on labs and practical exercises to engage students and prepare them for challenges they may encounter in the workplace.

Students will occasionally present their solutions to homework assignments in class.

The final project will provide students opportunity to showcase what they have learned in a format similar to what they will encounter in a professional work setting. 

__Grading Criteria__

Students are expected to participate in class discussions. Missed lectures result in an attendance score of zero for that lecture. Students will occasionally present results of analysis to the entire class. Student participation in online classes is expected; __watching recorded lectures outside of class does not count towards attendance!__.

Assignments and quizzes are graded on a 10 point scale. For the homework due dates please check the weekly schedule below. Also there will be pop quizes. Not all assignments and quizzes will be counted towards the course grade. Which assignments are counted for the course are randomly selected; these selections are not disclosed to students. Everyone gets the same random selection of assignments. All assignments are scored.
